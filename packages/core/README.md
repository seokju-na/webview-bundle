### Header

- **Magic Number (8 bytes)**
  - Big endian format. Value : `0xf09f8c90` / `0xf09f8e81`
  - Represents "üåêüéÅ" as utf8 encoding.
- **Version (1 bytes)**
  - Version field for this webview bundle format.
  - Available versions:
    - version1: `0x01`
- **Index Size (4 bytes)**
  - 4 bytes unsigned big endian value (`u32`)
  - Indicates the size of the Index field to be read next.
- **Header checksum (4 bytes)**
  - Checksum verifies that the full header data has been decoded correctly.
  - The checksum is the result of [xxHash-32 algorithm](https://github.com/Cyan4973/xxHash/blob/release/doc/xxhash_spec.md) digesting the header data as input.

### Index

- **Index**
  - This field has dynamic bytes size which is determined by the value of the Index Size field, and value is a big endian format.
  - Format of index should be `HashMap` formatted with binary encoded:
    - Key is a path for this file.
    - Value contains offset, length for reading contents from the data field.
    - Value can contain http headers which will be included in the response.
- **Index checksum (4 bytes)**
  - Checksum verifies that the full index data has been decoded correctly.
  - The checksum is the result of [xxHash-32 algorithm](https://github.com/Cyan4973/xxHash/blob/release/doc/xxhash_spec.md) digesting the encoded index data as input.

### Data

- **Data**
  - This field has dynamic bytes size which can be determined each file offset and length from Index.
  - The content of data is compressed with [lz4 block format](https://github.com/lz4/lz4/blob/dev/doc/lz4_Block_format.md).
  - The last 4 bytes are the checksum which is the result of [xxHash-32 algorithm](https://github.com/Cyan4973/xxHash/blob/release/doc/xxhash_spec.md) digesting the compressed data as input.


## Remote HTTP Spec

### List bundles (`GET /bundles`)

This returns a list of bundle names.

Remote bundles must be version-specified. Therefore, bundles with un-deployed versions should be excluded from the response.

```http request
GET /bundles
Host: wvb.example.com
Accept: application/json

### Response
HTTP 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

["bundle_name_1", "bundle_name_2"]
```

### Get the current bundle info (`HEAD /bundles/{name}`)

Get a bundle metadata with the specified name.

Bundle metadata includes the following metadata in response headers:

- `webview-bundle-name` : The name of this bundle.
- `webview-bundle-version` : Currently deployed version of this bundle.
- `webview-bundle-integrity` : (Optional) Integrity of this bundle which can be used for verification.

```http request
HEAD /bundles/{name}
Host: wvb.example.com

### Response
HTTP 200 OK
Content-Type: application/webview-bundle
Webview-Bundle-Name: bundle_name_1
Webview-Bundle-Version: 1.0.0
Webview-Bundle-Integrity: ...
```

#### Exceptions

If the bundle does not exist, or the bundle is not deployed, the server will return a 404 Not Found response.

```http request
HEAD /bundles/{name}
Host: wvb.example.com

### Response
HTTP 404 Not Found
```

### Download the current bundle (`GET /bundles/{name}`)

Download the current bundle with the specified name.

Bundle metadata includes the following metadata in response headers:

- `webview-bundle-name` : The name of this bundle.
- `webview-bundle-version` : Currently deployed version of this bundle.
- `webview-bundle-integrity` : (Optional) Integrity of this bundle which can be used for verification.

```http request
GET /bundles/{name}
Host: wvb.example.com

### Response
HTTP 200 OK
Content-Type: application/webview-bundle
Webview-Bundle-Name: bundle_name_1
Webview-Bundle-Version: 1.0.0
Webview-Bundle-Integrity: ...
```

#### Exceptions

If the bundle does not exist, or the bundle is not deployed, the server will return a 404 Not Found response.

```http request
HEAD /bundles/{name}
Host: wvb.example.com

### Response
HTTP 404 Not Found
```

### Download a specific version of the bundle (`GET /bundles/{name}/{version}`)

Get a specific version of the bundle with the specified name and version.

In the enterprise cases, you may want to prevent downloading specific versions. You can disable this feature by using the `allowOnlyLatest` option.

```http request
GET /bundles/{name}/{version}
Host: wvb.example.com

### Response
HTTP 200 OK
Content-Type: application/webview-bundle
Webview-Bundle-Name: bundle_name_1
Webview-Bundle-Version: 1.0.0
Webview-Bundle-Integrity: ...
```

#### Exceptions

If the bundle does not exist, or the bundle is not deployed, the server will return a 404 Not Found response.

```http request
GET /bundles/{name}/{version}
Host: wvb.example.com

### Response
HTTP 404 Not Found
```

If the `allowOnlyLatest` option is enabled, the server will return a 403 Forbidden response.

```http request
GET /bundles/{name}/{version}
Host: wvb.example.com

### Response
HTTP 403 Forbidden
```
